It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. If you're new to jQuery, we recommend that you check out the jQuery Learning Center .\nIf you're updating to a newer version of jQuery, be sure to read the release notes published on our blog . If you're coming from a version prior 1.9, you should check out the 1.9 Upgrade Guide as well.\nNote that this is the API documentation for jQuery core.
